"""Pydantic models for filing metadata + the FilingType code table.

This module covers only the **filing-metadata** record (SPEC §6.1) — the record
always derivable from the annual index XML. PTR/FD body schemas (§6.3) belong to
later milestones.

Every nullability and edge case here traces to a *verified* observation in real
2024 index data (SPEC §2.1):

- empty ``StateDst`` / ``FilingDate`` (seen on type ``W``) → both nullable
- non-state ``StateDst`` like ``DC00`` / ``PR00`` → state is any 2-letter postal
  code; never validated against the 50 states
- district ``00`` → ``0`` = at-large / n.a.
- 4-digit ``DocID`` alongside 7- and 8-digit → opaque string, never numeric
- raw ``FilingType`` letter preserved beside its mapped label; an unknown letter
  still yields a valid record (never a silently dropped filing)

# Integer schema generation, stamped into ``parse-manifest.json`` (SPEC §6.5) and
# *is* the minor of the release version ``v0.<SCHEMA_VERSION>.<patch>`` (GH-0037).
# It moves iff the parsed-data schema changes — which forces a re-parse, not a
# migrate (CLAUDE.md): bump this, delete old code, re-run ``parse`` from ``raw/``.
# Read by ``parse`` (#6), the per-PDF pass (#7), and the release tool. Generation
# 3 adds PTR body extraction (§6.3 transactions[]); generation 4 adds e-filed FD
# schedule bodies (§6.3 schedules A–D structured, E–J raw_text-only); generation 5
# adds the CC0 ``congress-legislators`` identity join (#16) — a ``bioguide_id`` and
# a two-tier ``filer_id`` ladder (``bioguide:<id>`` / ``name:<slug>``) — and
# structured columns for FD schedules E–J (#17), each item still carrying
# verbatim ``raw_text``; and an ``exact`` point-value on ``AmountRange`` (#49)
# so a single exact-dollar PTR amount (e.g. ``$894.97``) is represented soundly
# rather than coerced into a fake low–high bucket. All of these ride generation 5.
# Generation 6 (GH-0070): ``PtrTransaction.cap_gains_over_200`` becomes nullable
# (None = unknown — the glyphs-lost rendering drops the checkbox from the text
# layer entirely) and ``ScheduleAItem`` gains ``income_preceding`` (the
# Candidate/New-Filer form variant's third income column). The same generation
# re-anchors FD Schedule A/B/D/F row segmentation and adds the A/B completeness
# guard, so a re-parse from ``raw/`` is required — which the bump forces.
# Generation 7 (GH-0114): ``asset_type`` is now **normalized** (uppercased,
# trimmed) on ``PtrTransaction`` / ``ScheduleAItem`` / ``ScheduleBItem`` — the
# Clerk's PDFs render the bracketed tag with inconsistent casing
# (``ST``/``sT``/``Cs``/``gS``), so every consumer had to defensively upper() it.
# The verbatim tag is preserved beside it in a new ``asset_type_raw`` field
# (raw alongside normalized — CLAUDE.md). Re-parse from ``raw/`` required.
# Generation 7 also adds a **parse-time date sanity range** (GH-0113): a
# disclosure date whose year falls outside ``1990 ≤ year ≤ entry_year + 1`` (the
# upper bound derived from the single command-entry timestamp, never the wall
# clock in core logic) is an extraction artifact — a transposed-digit year like
# ``3031`` parses as readily as ``2024``. Such a date is **rejected**, never
# emitted as a valid ``date``: the structured field is ``None`` and the raw
# ``M/D/YYYY`` string is preserved in a sibling ``*_raw`` field (``date_raw`` /
# ``notification_date_raw`` on ``PtrTransaction``, ``transaction_date_raw`` on
# ``ScheduleBItem``). A set ``*_raw`` is the per-row anomaly flag; ``parse``
# surfaces it in ``unparsed-manifest.json`` (reason ``date_out_of_range``)
# without dropping the otherwise-good filing (raw alongside normalized, never a
# silent gap — CLAUDE.md). ``PtrTransaction.transaction_date`` /
# ``notification_date`` therefore become ``Optional``. Re-parse from ``raw/``
# required.
# Generation 8 (GH-0100): FD Schedule A row anchoring recovers wrapped-``[TYPE]``
# and ⇒-subholding rows whose value prints a line above their tag — assets that
# previously folded silently into the row above (the #70 regression). The parser
# now anchors a tag-less line on its ``$lo -`` value low, and a None/Over-value
# row whose tag wrapped via a one-line lookahead at the wrapped tag-tail; a row
# that still cannot be separated (≥2 asset-type codes in one row) is flagged as a
# ``schedule_incomplete`` residual (``unparsed-manifest.json``) without dropping
# the filing — completeness over the known, explicit residual for the rest
# (CLAUDE.md). Recovered rows change parsed output, so re-parse from ``raw/`` is
# required — which the bump forces.
# Generation 9 (GH-0143): FD schedule column-content extraction re-fixes the
# v0.8.0 attempts (#130/#131/#133/#134) missed on harder real-filing variants —
# intact-letter Schedule H/J header suppression + J source/description split
# (#146); a populated trailing Schedule I anchors on its amount column instead of
# fabricating appendix rows (#147); Schedule C owner-prefixed open-vocabulary Type
# no longer bleeds into source and Schedule D non-standard dates no longer collapse
# the row (#148); two-income (candidate) Schedule A maps current-year ``None`` and
# the preceding-year range correctly (#149, confirming #132); Schedule E splits
# identical-position blocks and folds ``C :`` comment lines (#150). All change
# parsed output, so re-parse from ``raw/`` is required — which the bump forces.
# Generation 10 (#174): the source namespace. The on-disk layout moved to
# ``raw/clerk/<year>/`` + ``parsed/clerk/<year>/``, so each record's stored
# ``source_pdf`` now reads ``raw/clerk/<year>/<family>/<DocID>.pdf``. That changes
# ``filings.json`` bytes, so a tree migrated by a bare ``mv`` (which relocates the
# JSON but not its embedded paths) must be re-parsed for ``source_pdf`` to point at
# the moved bytes — the bump makes ``read``'s schema-drift warning surface that.

      string. Not "fixed" for the small-caps glyph artifact.

      the asset name, **uppercased** to defeat pdfplumber's small-caps glyph
      artifact (raw ``AAPl``/``bRK.b`` → ``AAPL``/``BRK.B``). ``None`` when the

      etc. legitimately have none — ``None`` is correct, never a sentinel). A
      ticker is never inferred from the company name.
    - ``asset_type`` — the bracketed tag (``ST`` from ``[ST]``), **normalized**
      (uppercased, trimmed) so it is comparable across the corpus; ``None`` when
      the row carries no tag (GH-0114).
    - ``asset_type_raw`` — the same tag **verbatim** (preserving the Clerk's
      inconsistent casing, e.g. ``sT``/``Cs``/``gS``); raw alongside normalized
      (CLAUDE.md). ``None`` exactly when ``asset_type`` is.

      prints ``S (partial)``; normalized to ``S(partial)``).
    - ``transaction_date`` / ``notification_date`` — ISO ``YYYY-MM-DD``, or
      ``None`` when the date failed the parse-time sanity range (year outside
      ``1990 … entry_year+1`` — an extraction artifact such as a transposed-digit
      year). When ``None`` for that reason the raw ``M/D/YYYY`` string is kept in
      ``date_raw`` / ``notification_date_raw`` (GH-0113); ``parse`` then records
      the anomaly in ``unparsed-manifest.json`` rather than dropping the filing.
    - ``date_raw`` / ``notification_date_raw`` — the verbatim out-of-range date
      string, set **only** when the corresponding structured date was rejected;
      ``None`` on every sound row.
    - ``amount_range`` — the parsed amount: a ``{low, high, label}`` bucket, or
      an ``{exact, label}`` point when the row discloses a single exact dollar
      value instead of a range (GH-0049).
    - ``cap_gains_over_200`` — the cap-gains checkbox (the form renders
      ``gfedc`` unchecked vs ``gfedcb`` checked at the row's end). ``None``
      means **unknown**: in the glyphs-lost rendering (SPEC §2.2 NUL form,
